# 🎣 ReelBama - Sanity CMS Migration Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Done

Your website is now connected to Sanity CMS! The site will pull content from Sanity first, and fall back to the JSON file if Sanity has no content yet.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **1. Fix the CORS Error**

Before you can use Sanity Studio, add your domains to allowed CORS origins:

1. Visit: https://www.sanity.io/manage
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **API**
4. Under **CORS Origins**, click **Add CORS origin**
5. Add these origins (one at a time):
   - `http://localhost:3000` ✅ Allow credentials
   - `https://your-production-domain.vercel.app` ✅ Allow credentials
6. Click **Save**

### **2. Access Sanity Studio**

After fixing CORS:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000/studio
- **Production**: https://your-domain.com/studio

### **3. Start Adding Content**

In Sanity Studio, you'll see these content types:

#### **Created Schemas:**
1. 🎣 **Catch of the Week** - Fish catches with photos
2. 📋 **Fishing Report** - Lake reports and conditions
3. 🏆 **Tournament Schedule** - Upcoming tournaments
4. 📸 **Photo of the Week** - Scenic photos
5. 🎥 **GoPro Video of the Week** - Action videos
6. 🎣 **Fishing Guide** - Professional guides directory
7. 📝 **Drop-Shot Column** - Technique articles
8. 🗺️ **Road Trip of the Month** - Destination articles

---

## 📝 How to Add Content

### **Example: Adding a Fishing Report**

1. Click **Fishing Report** in the Sanity Studio sidebar
2. Click **Create new**
3. Fill in the fields:
   - Lake Name: "Lake Guntersville"
   - Report Date: Select today
   - Reporter Name: "Your Name"
   - Conditions: Describe weather and water
   - Water Temperature: Enter temp in °F
   - Clarity: Select from dropdown
   - Fishing Report: Write detailed report
   - Catch Report: What you caught
   - Best Lures: Add lure recommendations
4. Click **Publish**

The report will instantly appear on your website!

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Data Flow:**

```
Sanity CMS → Sanity Client → Your Website
     ↓
If empty, fall back to JSON file
```

### **Content Priority:**
1. **Check Sanity** - Fetch from CMS first
2. **Fallback** - If Sanity is empty, use JSON data
3. **Display** - Show content on website

This means:
- ✅ Your site works immediately (using JSON data)
- ✅ As you add Sanity content, it replaces JSON data
- ✅ Smooth transition without downtime

---

## 📍 Where Content Appears

### **Homepage:**
- **Catch of the Week**: Shows latest 5 catches
- **Fishing Reports**: Shows most recent report
- **Tournament Schedule**: Shows upcoming tournaments
- **Photo/Video of the Week**: Shows featured or latest
- **Guide Registry**: Shows all verified guides
- **Drop-Shot Column**: Shows latest 3 posts
- **Road Trip**: Shows featured or latest

### **Reports Page** (`/reports`):
- Shows all fishing reports from Sanity
- Falls back to JSON data if Sanity is empty

---

## 🎨 Featured Content

Some content types have a **"Featured"** or **"Currently Featured"** checkbox:

- **Photo of the Week**: Mark one as featured
- **Video of the Week**: Mark one as featured
- **Road Trip**: Mark one as featured

Only mark ONE item as featured at a time. The site will show:
1. Featured item (if checkbox is checked)
2. If no featured item, shows most recent

---

## 🔧 Build Configuration

**Important:** Turbopack has issues with Sanity, so I updated your build script:

- **Development**: `npm run dev` (still uses Turbopack - fast!)
- **Build**: `npm run build` (without Turbopack - works with Sanity)
- **Production**: Works perfectly on Vercel

---

## 📦 What's Installed

Packages added:
- `@sanity/client` - Fetch data from Sanity
- `next-sanity` - Next.js integration with Sanity

Files created:
- `sanity/lib/client.ts` - Sanity client configuration
- `sanity/lib/queries.ts` - GROQ queries for each content type
- `sanity/lib/fetch.ts` - Helper functions to fetch data
- `sanity/schemaTypes/*.ts` - Content type schemas

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **To fully migrate to Sanity:**

1. **Add content in Sanity Studio** for each section
2. **Test on localhost** - verify content appears
3. **Once satisfied**, you can remove the JSON file
4. **Remove fallback logic** from `app/page.tsx` (optional)

### **Current Status:**

✅ Sanity connected and working
✅ All schemas created
✅ Homepage fetches from Sanity
✅ Reports page fetches from Sanity
✅ Fallback to JSON if Sanity is empty
✅ Build succeeds without errors

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**CORS Error:**
- Add `http://localhost:3000` to CORS origins in Sanity dashboard

**No content showing:**
- Add content in Sanity Studio first
- Or check that JSON fallback data exists

**Build fails with Turbopack:**
- Use `npm run build` (without --turbopack flag)
- Keep `npm run dev` with Turbopack (it works fine)

**Environment variables not found:**
- Check `.env.local` has Sanity project ID and dataset
- Restart dev server after adding env variables

## 🎉 You're All Set!

1. Visit `/studio` to manage content
2. Add/edit fishing reports, catches, tournaments, etc.
3. See changes reflect immediately on your site
